# VulnHub

I'm participating to the VulnHub challenges: https://www.vulnhub.com/

Vulnhub is a platform proposing virtual machines allowing to train to computer security on different systems (operating systems, networks or web).

Successful challenge on the following virtual machines:

### Symfonos 2
OSCP-like Intermediate real life based machine designed to teach the importance of understanding a vulnerability. SHOULD work for both VMware and Virtualbox.

### HA: Forensics
HA: Forensics is an intermediate level of the lab, which gives you a hand on real-life experience in Cyber Forensic Investigation. This lab is completely dedicated to methods and tools of Cyber Forensic Investigation and there is evidence that can be found with various techniques. As it is a Capture-the-Flag, it is very important to note that it is not a root challenge, and comes with a primary motive to find all the flags.

### Kioptrix level 1
The object of the game is to acquire root access via any means possible (except actually hacking the VM server or player). The purpose of these games are to learn the basic tools and techniques in vulnerability assessment and exploitation. There are more ways then one to successfully complete the challenges.

### Kioptrix level 3
As with the other two, this challenge is geared towards the beginner. It is however different. Added a few more steps and a new skill set is required. Still being the realm of the beginner I must add. The same as the others, there’s more then one way to “pwn” this one. There’s easy and not so easy. Remember… the sense of “easy” or “difficult” is always relative to ones own skill level. I never said these things were exceptionally hard or difficult, but we all need to start somewhere. And let me tell you, making these vulnerable VMs is not as easy as it looks…
